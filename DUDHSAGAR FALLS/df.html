    <section class="history">
        <p>Considered one of India's tallest waterfalls, Dudsagar waterfalls are truly a brilliant example of epic beauty. It is situated in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, forming a border between Karnataka and Goa. Deciduous forests surround this particular area. The waters cascading down from the rocks form a magical view of the place, especially in the monsoon season. On various occasions, one can also see a train crossing by from in front of the falls. This scene is simply a visual delight. 

            When one looks at these waterfalls from a distance, it seems like an overwhelming stream of milk falling with much pressure from the top to down the hill that forms three streams, making their way to the ocean. Falling from a height of 310 meters, Dudhsagar falls are the fifth largest in India. This wonder of nature attracts the attention of a lot of tourists on an annual basis. This destination is a must-visit for someone who likes to explore nature and has a great love for photography. </p>
        <h2>Myths and Legends</h2>
        <p>There are some legends and stories which are associated with this place for a long time. According to one such story, it is believed that once there was a princess, the daughter of the king of Ghats.</p>
        <p>One day she was bathing in the lake situated near the palace. After completing her chore, the princess and her maidens sat beside the lake and drank milk from a jug, apparently made of gold and embedded with precious stones and diamonds. She repeated it on a different day; a handsome prince chanced to be riding in the woods nearby. When he heard the laughing sound of the girls, he became curious and wanted to know what was happening. And after some searching, he found and saw the barely clad princess. However, to protect her honor, the maidens, in a frantic attempt, poured the milk from the jug around her. And it is this reason why these popular waterfalls are known as Dudhsagar. </p>
        <h2>The Dudhsagar Trek</h2>
        <p>Lately, there is a lot of hype regarding the Dudhsagar trek stating that it is closed for the general public.
             It is brought to the notice that the Dudhsagar railway trek has been closed officially for the general public 
             but the trek to the bottom of the Dudhsagar is still open for one and all. Two routes would help you to reach there. 
             The first option is when you start the trek from Kulem and follow the jeep trail until you reach the bottom of the waterfall. 
             The second option is when you enter the base of the waterfall through the railway track. If you wish to, then you can trek up to 
             the Sonaulim station and then join the way back to the Mud route. Therefore, this route would help you save 2 km on the Mud road.  
        </p>
