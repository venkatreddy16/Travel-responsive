		<div class="section">
			<div class="row">
				<p>As a hill station, Ooty enjoys a cool and pleasant climate round the year. However, the best time to visit
                     happens to be the summer months - from early March to early June, when the weather is absolutely at its best.
                      Ooty enjoys a moderate rainfall during the monsoons and winters are not too harsh either. Though temperature 
                      may fall to 2°C or 3°C, despite that, exploring Ooty in winters has its own charm.
