			<h3><u>History and legends of origin :</u></h3>
			<p>The temple,at a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatm states that it is so called because "the crop of liberation" grows here.	</p>
			<p>Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.</p>
			<div class="content">
				<p>A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slew their cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.</p>
			<p>Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" — the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva.</p>
			<p>A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.</p>
			<p>After completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.</p>
			<P>The Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does not mention any place called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which contains a story describing the origin of the Ganges river. The text names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy water from his matted hair.</P>
			<p>According to the hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-shankara-vijaya, the 8th century philosopher Adi Shankara died at the mountains near Kedarnath; although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri's Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of a monument marking the purported death place of Shankara are located at Kedarnath. Kedarnath was definitely a prominent pilgrimage centre by the 12th century, when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara.</p>
			<p>Kedarnath Teerth Purohits are the ancient Brahmins of this region, their ancestors (Rishi-Muni) have been worshiping the lingam since the time of Nara-Narayana and Daksh Prajapati. King Janmejay, grandson of the Pandavas, gave them the right of worshiping this temple and donate the whole Kedar region, and they have been worshiping pilgrims ever since.According to a tradition recorded by the English mountaineer Eric Shipton (1926), "many hundreds of years ago" one priest used to hold services at both the Kedarnath and Badrinath temples, travelling between the two places daily.</p>

				<h2>Travel Option</h2>
				<i class="fa-solid fa-plane-circle-check"><span>How to Reach Kedarnath by Air</span></i>
				<p>The most expedient and efficient way of getting to the auspicious destination of Kedarnath is via air. Due to the altitude and location of the state of Uttarakhand, the Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage can be quite strenuous. This means one would most likely want to reach the base camp of Gaurikund as quickly as possible, reserving all energy for the uphill trek to Kedarnath. </p>
			    <p>While Kedarnath doesn’t operate its own aerodrome, individuals can avail of the nearest air hub in Dehradun. Jolly Grant Airport is situated approximately 238 to 250 km from Kedarnath, playing a pivotal role in Uttarakhand tourism. The airport is well connected to major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata and Lucknow. Individuals may select from the following carriers – IndiGo, Spice Jet and Air India. In terms of the fastest route, New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport is only 260 km away, offering a flight duration of 45 minutes to an hour. Upon arrival, individuals may select from general, prepaid and private taxis as well as the city bus service to reach Kedarnath.</p>
			    <p>Jolly Grant Airport is equipped with all the necessary facilities, including high-speed WiFi, infotainment, buffet and bar services. This means travellers can breathe a sigh of relief as their arrival will be met with a host of amenities.</p>

				<div class="travel1">
				<i class="fa-solid fa-train-subway"><span>How to Reach kedarnath by Train</span></i>
				<p>For those looking for a more cost-effective transportation medium, there are options available to you. However, bear in mind that this increases the duration of your commute significantly as the destination is a starting point to another journey itself.</p>
			    <p>Although there isn’t a railway junction in Kedarnath, individuals can avail of the railhead at Rishikesh. Situated approximately 210 km from Gaurikund, Rishikesh Railway Station is well connected to the capital city. Individuals may hop onto a fast train from Delhi to Rishikesh, which will take approximately 8 hours in duration. Upon arrival, there are regular buses that ply to the base camp, from which the trek begins.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="travel1">
					<i class="fa-solid fa-car"><span>How to Reach kedarnath by roads</span></i>
					<p>In order to get to Kedarnath by road, travellers will have to get to the capital city of Delhi first. From Delhi, one can reach Dehradun by flight, train or bus. It is from Dehradun that you will be making your way to Haridwar and from this sacred city you will be heading for the path that leads to the Kedarnath trek. There are two major interstate bus depots from Delhi that schedule regular buses to Dehradun, namely - Kashmere Gate Bus Terminal and Anand Vihar Bus Terminal. Individuals may select from A/C sleeper, non-A/C sleeper, Volvo A/C, Volvo A/C and semi-sleeper buses, depending upon their needs.</p>
					<p>We have chalked out a rough road route for you to get a sense of the magnitude of the journey: New Delhi > Haridwar (206 km) > Rishikesh (24 km) > Devprayag (74 km) > Srinagar (34 km) > Rudraprayag (33 km) > Gaurikund (via Augustmuni > Guptkashi > Phata > Sitapur > Sonprayag (74 km) > Kedarnath by trek (16 km).</p>
					<p>Take note that this is a long and exhausting commute. We’d recommend getting to Gaurikund as quickly as possible, as the trip ahead is even more physically taxing.</p>
